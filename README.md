# Haskell-TicTacToe
A tic tac toe game made in Haskell

In order to play the game, use the main function in the file TicTacToeGame.hs 
A badly created AI is included which is, as far as I know, Impossible to beat.

The files which are not named "TicTacToe* " are also used in a gneral boardgame envirioment which I am developing. See my other repositories to look at them. Thus there may be some functions in the files which are not used for TicTacToe, but for "harder"  games.
